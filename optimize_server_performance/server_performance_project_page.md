**Project description:** 

Many companies rely on VMWare NUMA's advanced server platforms to run their business applications. 
Default settings can lead to misconfigurations of the server settings and thus inflated server costs.
But most companies don't know in advance which misconfigurations will reduce costs enough to justify the time and costs of a fix.


### 1. Hypothesis

Machine learning could help operations teams to reduce server costs and downtime, by building predictive models for server efficiency forecasting. 
The immediate objective, case-specific predictions, could help operations teams to estimate the impact of investments in reconfiguration in order to better prioritize maintenance spending. 
In future, dynamic simulations of configuration changes could proactively suggest configuration changes as well.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assumptions 

- Sufficient data to capture the shifting relationships between configurations settings, usage trends, and different system architectures/versions. Somne may be easier to model than others.
- Key drivers are represented in the available data sets.


```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Statistical tools and techniques

- Aggregation of data from reporting and logging
- Feature engineering to generate new variables, including synthetic usage statistics used in projections
- Experimented with several regression models: Multiple linear regression, decision tree, random forest, xgboost regressor

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection

If the pilot project prioves successful, we will propose further development with additional organizations.
